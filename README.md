  ## üî≠ Vision 

**SAGE OS** is not just another operating system. It is a living, evolving system designed to:

- Think autonomously
- Learn from usage patterns
- Optimize itself through artificial intelligence
- Rebuild and evolve its components as needed

This is an experiment at the intersection of **kernel engineering**, **embedded systems**, and **machine intelligence** ‚Äî pushing the boundaries of what an operating system can become.

  <summary>üéØ Objectives</summary>

- Build a fully bootable, bare-metal operating system from scratch
- Integrate basic AI/ML models to inform system-level decisions
- Enable self-monitoring and self-optimization over time
- Keep the codebase portable across architectures (starting with ARM/RPi)

  This image illustrates the **"Self-Evolving, AI-Driven OS Lifecycle"** ‚Äî a conceptual flow for how your SAGE OS can autonomously detect hardware, build itself, and evolve across platforms.

### üîç Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **AI Detects Architecture and Hardware**

   * On boot or install, SAGE OS's embedded AI analyzes the CPU type, memory, buses, I/O interfaces, and connected devices.

2. **Generate Platform-Specific Kernel and Drivers**

   * Based on the detected architecture (ARM, x86, RISC-V, etc.), the AI compiles or adapts the kernel and drivers tailored to the platform.

3. **Build Disk Image or Container**

   * The AI assembles a bootable `.img`, `.iso`, or container that includes the new kernel, drivers, and shell environment.

4. **Boot Automatically**

   * The new OS version is booted directly, either on the device or inside a VM/emulator (like QEMU) for testing.

5. **Monitor Performance and Stability**

   * AI continuously checks system behavior: uptime, crashes, latency, driver responses, etc.

6. **Stable ‚Üí Keep New Image**

   * If everything runs well, the system promotes this version as the active build.

7. **Unstable ‚Üí Roll Back**

   * If issues are found, the AI automatically rolls back to the previous known-good state.

This workflow allows **SAGE OS to evolve, rebuild, and test itself across any platform** ‚Äî moving toward true autonomy and architectural universality.

  <summary>üöÄ Building and Running SAGE OS</summary>

## Prerequisites

To build and run SAGE OS, you need the following tools:

- GCC cross-compilers for your target architectures:
  - `x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc` for x86_64
  - `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` for ARM64/AArch64
  - `riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc` for RISC-V 64-bit

- QEMU for emulation:
  - `qemu-system-x86_64` for x86_64
  - `qemu-system-aarch64` for ARM64/AArch64
  - `qemu-system-riscv64` for RISC-V 64-bit

### Installing Prerequisites

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
# Install cross-compilers
sudo apt-get install gcc-x86-64-linux-gnu gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu

# Install QEMU
sudo apt-get install qemu-system-x86 qemu-system-arm qemu-system-misc
```

## Building SAGE OS

To build SAGE OS for a specific architecture:

```bash
# Clean previous build artifacts
make clean

# Build for x86_64
make ARCH=x86_64

# Build for ARM64/AArch64
make ARCH=aarch64

# Build for RISC-V 64-bit
make ARCH=riscv64
```

The build process creates:
- Object files for each source file
- `kernel.elf` - The linked ELF executable
- `kernel8.img` - The raw binary image

## Running SAGE OS

### Using QEMU

You can run SAGE OS in QEMU using the provided script:

```bash
# Run on x86_64
./scripts/test_emulated.sh x86_64

# Run on ARM64/AArch64
./scripts/test_emulated.sh aarch64

# Run on RISC-V 64-bit
./scripts/test_emulated.sh riscv64
```

### Running on Real Hardware

For Raspberry Pi (ARM64):
1. Copy `kernel8.img` to the boot partition of your SD card
2. Make sure `config.txt` contains `arm_64bit=1`
3. Boot your Raspberry Pi

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. Add your source files to the appropriate directory
2. Update the Makefile if necessary
3. Build and test using the commands above

### License Compliance

All source files must include the BSD 3-Clause License header. You can check for compliance using:

```bash
./license-checker.py
```

If you need to add license headers to new files:

```bash
./add_license_headers.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

- **Missing compiler**: Make sure you have installed the appropriate cross-compiler for your target architecture
- **Linker errors**: Check that all required object files are being included in the link step

### Runtime Errors

- **Kernel doesn't boot**: Verify that the boot code for your architecture is correctly implemented
- **QEMU crashes**: Make sure you're using the correct QEMU parameters for your architecture
