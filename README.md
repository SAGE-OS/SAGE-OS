# SAGE OS 🌱🧠

**Self-Aware General Environment**  
An experimental, bare-metal operating system designed from scratch to learn, adapt, and evolve — starting on Raspberry Pi.

> For detailed usage instructions, see [USAGE_GUIDE.md](./USAGE_GUIDE.md)

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg)

## 🔭 Vision 

**SAGE OS** is not just another operating system. It is a living, evolving system designed to:

- Think autonomously
- Learn from usage patterns
- Optimize itself through artificial intelligence
- Rebuild and evolve its components as needed

This is an experiment at the intersection of **kernel engineering**, **embedded systems**, and **machine intelligence** — pushing the boundaries of what an operating system can become.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Architecture Support**: Full support for i386, x86_64, aarch64, arm, and riscv64
- **Custom Bootloaders**: Architecture-specific boot code with multiboot support
- **Bare-Metal Kernel**: Written in C and assembly for maximum performance
- **AI Subsystem**: Integrated AI capabilities with the AI HAT+ accelerator
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory allocation and management
- **Shell Interface**: Interactive command-line interface with VGA/UART output
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Support for Raspberry Pi 3, 4, 5, and x86 systems
- **Device Drivers**: UART, VGA, Serial, GPIO, I2C, SPI, and AI HAT+ drivers
- **QEMU Emulation**: Full testing support with safe tmux-based testing
- **Docker Integration**: Containerized builds and deployment
- **Security Scanning**: Comprehensive CVE vulnerability scanning
- **Build System**: Automated multi-architecture builds with macOS support

## 🧠 AI & Machine Learning Integration

SAGE OS includes embedded, resource-efficient AI components that can:
- Perform local inference using the AI HAT+ with up to 26 TOPS
- Support multiple model formats and precisions (FP32, FP16, INT8, INT4)
- Observe usage and optimize scheduling
- Trigger self-diagnostics and reconfiguration
- Dynamically adjust power consumption based on workload
- Monitor system health and performance
- Eventually, enable modular regeneration of subsystems

The AI HAT+ provides hardware acceleration for neural networks with:
- Up to 26 TOPS of neural processing power
- 4GB of dedicated memory for AI models
- Support for various model types (classification, detection, segmentation, generation)
- Power-efficient operation with multiple power modes
- Temperature monitoring and thermal management
- High-speed data transfer using SPI and control via I2C

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Languages**: ARM Assembly, C (kernel), Rust (core components), Python (tools & ML prototyping)
- **Platform**: Raspberry Pi 4B/5 (64-bit ARMv8/ARMv9)
- **Toolchain**: `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc`, `rustc`, `QEMU`, `CMake`, TinyML (TFLM, uTensor)
- **Build Environment**: Cross-compilation (Linux, macOS)
- **AI Acceleration**: AI HAT+ with up to 26 TOPS neural processing
